Welcome to Orbtrace
===================

Orbtrace is a lightweight, cost effective, USB2-HS Debug and Trace interface for ARM CORTEX-M processors. It allows you to debug your code on target using [CMSIS-DAP](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/General/html/index.html) and, optionally, to extract Debug and Trace data from it in real time, according to the [Arm Debug Interface Architecture Specification ADIv5](https://documentation-service.arm.com/static/5f900b1af86e16515cdc0642).
